# 🚗 Vehicle Detection and License Plate Recognition 🚙

## Description

📖 This Python code performs vehicle detection and license plate recognition in video footage using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm. It reads a video file, detects vehicles and license plates, tracks vehicles across frames, and extracts license plate information.

## Features

🌟 Key Features:

- 🚗 Vehicle Detection: Uses the YOLO model to detect vehicles in each frame of the video.
- 🚦 Object Tracking: Applies the SORT algorithm to track vehicles across frames.
- 📝 License Plate Recognition: Detects license plates and reads their text content.
- 💾 Data Export: Stores the results in a CSV file for further analysis.
